Purpose:
Learn how routing works in React, and how to navigate between pages using React Router v6+.

## What is React Router?

React Router is a library for handling navigation in React apps — it allows users to move between pages **without full-page reloads**.

It’s what makes your app behave like a **Single Page Application (SPA)**.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
