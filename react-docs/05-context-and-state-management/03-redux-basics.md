## Purpose
Understand **Redux**, the industry-standard library for **state management in large React apps**.

## ⚙️ What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable **state container** for JavaScript apps.  
It helps manage **global state** across components in a consistent way.


## 🧩 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Store** | Holds global state |
| **Actions** | Describe *what happened* |
| **Reducers** | Decide *how state changes* |
| **Dispatch** | Sends an action to the store |
